# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM  

This project demonstrates the use of **Deep Learning (LSTM)** to predict **Tesla (TSLA) stock prices** based on historical data.  
The model learns temporal patterns in stock price movements and forecasts future trends.  

---

## Project Overview
- Collected Tesla stock data (`TSLA.csv`)  
- Preprocessed data with **MinMaxScaler**  
- Built and trained an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** model using TensorFlow/Keras  
- Evaluated model with test data  
- Visualized **Actual vs. Predicted** stock prices  

---

## Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **TensorFlow / Keras**  
- **scikit-learn**  
- **Pandas, NumPy**  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**  

---

## Results
- Model successfully learned stock price patterns  
- Prediction closely followed real values  
- Visualization clearly shows the modelâ€™s performance
